2. **Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms**
3. **Create testable authentication flows** to enable full feature testing  
4. **Address mobile responsive design concerns**

### Testing Recommendations:
1. **Establish continuous testing pipeline** with the current test suite
2. **Create test user accounts** for comprehensive feature testing
3. **Implement visual regression testing** to catch rendering issues
4. **Regular cross-browser testing** across all supported platforms

The application has solid bones but needs critical rendering issues resolved and comprehensive UX improvements before it can provide a reliable user experience. With focused effort on the identified critical issues, HabitNex can become a robust and user-friendly habit tracking application.
