## How to Use These Agents

When you need help with a specific area, invoke the agent by mentioning its trigger words. For example:

```
"Hey, I need to analyze habits to find patterns in my completion rates"
‚Üí Triggers Habit Analytics Agent

"Help me improve the UI with better loading animations"
‚Üí Triggers UI/UX Enhancement Agent

"Optimize our Firebase queries to reduce costs"
‚Üí Triggers Firebase Optimization Agent
```

Each agent has deep knowledge of our codebase structure, conventions, and existing implementations, allowing them to provide contextual, accurate assistance that maintains consistency with our project.

## Agent Collaboration

These agents can work together for complex tasks:
- **Analytics + UI/UX**: Create beautiful data visualizations
- **Firebase + Performance**: Optimize database queries for speed
- **Testing + Security**: Create security-focused test suites
- **AI + Gamification**: Create intelligent achievement recommendations
